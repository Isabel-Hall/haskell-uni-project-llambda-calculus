# haskell-uni-project-llambda-calculus
Functional Programming uni project to use Haskell to be able to create type derivations from terms in the llambda calculus

We were each given an implementation of the llambda calculus using Haskell. Our task was to individually create code that could carry out a complete typing derivation on an inputted term.

type_inference_and_derivation.hs contains my code for this project. We were provided with some helper code to implement the llambda calculus and display the results correctly. Anything under the the headings "Assignment 1-5" is entirely my own work.
